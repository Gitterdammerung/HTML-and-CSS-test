    <h1>Welcome stranger!</h1>
    <h4>Dearie me, this's a bit bleak, isn't it?</h4>
    <h5>Ah well, on with the show!</h5>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h4>About me</h4>
    <br>
    <p>My name is Malachi Cleland (pronounced Mala’kai, but feel free to call me Mal), my student number is s3965226 and my student email is s395226@rmit.edu.au.

I was born in Australia, currently live and grew up in a small country… um, area (town’d be a bit of a stretch), though I’m looking to move to Melbourne in the near future, having lived there for almost two years in the past when I almost-completed an advanced diploma.
I love writing, like drawing - haven't drawn in a while actually - pencil is my medium of choice as I’m a bit of an art snob / purist in that using a tablet and style (personally), is a bit of a cop out. It’s something about seeing my imagination forged in reality that really does it for me. Most of the time I’m not on the computer or 360/PS3, I’ll be reading my heart out. Or re-reading most everything on my bookshelves. Actually in completing this assignment I’ve developed a bit of a soft spot for HTML and CSS, so I’ll be pleased if I can carve some time out to learn more about the both of them and their applications.
<br>
<br>
<br>
I learnt Indonesian in Years 7 & 8, many moons ago, and would have continued down that track had it not clashed with small motors and engineering in Year 9, though I’ve wanted to learn plenty of languages since (German probably at the top of the list). I know that plenty of people don’t like to talk themselves up - myself included -, but over time in life you figure out what some of your talents are, and I honestly believe that I take to (spoken) languages like a duck to water, and on the list of ‘jobs to have before I kark it and reincarnate’, is translator, because bridging language barriers and bringing people together is a pretty beautiful thing, in my opinion. Plus if you do what you love you never call it work, right?
<br>
<br>
<br>
Also, apologies for the whole ‘staring into your soul’ thing (gap left on purpose).<p>

    <p>The picture is from an old concession card - I would have used the original as I still have a handful of those left, though at current I’ve got about two hours till this assignment is due (skipping back and forth between sections), so this’ll have to make do for now.</p>
    <br>
    <h4>My interest in I.T.</h4>
    <br>
    <p>My interest in information technology is rather focused, limited to programming, games and computers, with a very recent interest in the Raspberry Pi. I actually disagreed with the initial statement on one of the discussion boards that we can't unhook ourselves from IT, from a contrarian / devil's advocate point of view, as I don’t really see myself as that dependent on it (perhaps ‘dependant’ is the wrong word, but I would say I utilise it far less). However when I thought about it I started to agree: I basically live on my computer, when I’m not playing my 360 or ps3, then realised that with my living where I do, I really could do it. I live in the middle of nowhere, don’t watch TV and only use my phone for communication, a quick Google if I’m hooked to the net or social camouflage: easiest way to blend in is head down, looking at the phone. Legitimately, the other day I was in Bendigo and swiped my thumb around in a natural fashion, flicking back and forth from my music player to the main screen as I ambled along.</p>
    <br>
    <p>I don’t believe that there was a ever a magical, defining moment: my best mate in highschool can probably cop some of the blame: we were both pretty nerdy cats (relatively to where we lived) and everytime he upgraded his computer or got a new fangled gizmo like the Raspberry Pi, he told me all about it. Even when he pawned an old computer off on me (don’t think I ever got that working), seeing the guts of it… like circuit boards! Everything goes somewhere and even as a kid you could trace the golden lines to see where everything meets up. Much like my preference in the ladies (feel free to wince), I prefer the older models: I prefer CRT to a flatscreen, and though I’m using one right now I’d happily kill someone (someone mean and deserving, of course) for a square monitor. There was a book I read a while ago called ‘The Micro Revolution’, written in the 80’s I think, about microcomputers and microcontrollers, programming and where all that’s heading. Other than being mildly prophetic, it was rather simply explained how x-much data fits onto a computer chip - and while I don’t know if they’re still made in the same fashion today, . Even just the other day, cramming for an intro to programming project, coding in Python - this one piece of code was driving me up the blood wall, fixing it then breaking it, fixing it then breaking it, so much so that it really watered that seed of doubt ‘is this for me?’, but when I was finally on the right track I was buzzed! Walking down the hall thinking that that was one of the things that I missed most. Then the damn thing broke again, of course, and since it was already a few days late, this wouldn't hurt me too much anyway.
</p>
<br>
<p>I have almost 2 years of an Advanced Diploma of Professional Game Development, specialising in Game Design, under my belt. I learned C# and how to work Unity, art in Maya, texturing and 3D modelling. It’s difficult to explain what a game designer is or does, so we were specifically taught a  broad array of skills so that we could understand programmers and artists when they were excited or complaining, rather than just nod with a smile. In most all group work, I took on the role of a producer, bringing everyone together and bringing out the best in them.</p>
<br>
<p>Honestly, originally I didn't intend to come to RMIT. Truth is I saw on the Open Universities Australia page that there was group work for this subject (as a subset of a Bachelor of IT) and beat a hasty retreat. I then intended to go for UniSA’s Bachelor of I.T. and requested a callback. I didn’t hear anything from them but an OUA cat rang me asking how I got on. I remember telling him I was choosing not to go to RMIT (I actually forgot it was because of the group work but remembered that there was a reason I didn’t want to go, so I said it was because of inveigled exams and how that’s work for me with a bung net connection), then he pointed out UniSA doesn’t start for a few months, so I continued with my submission. Plus it’s got the history and faculty, and from what I can remember of the Year 12 trip, it’s campus was pretty cool.

<h4 style = "color:blue; text-align: center;">What do I expect to learn during my studies?</h4>
<br>

<p style = "color: red; text-align: center;">The old K.G.B. answer -  tell them what they want to hear! I want to learn how information technology connects the world around us and forms such an amazing part of our lives.</p>
<br>

<p style = "color: red; text-align: center;">Programming. I’m taking this specific course as a lead-in to the Bachelor of I.T. to learn how to program, among other things.</p>
<br>

<p style = "color: red; text-align: center;">I want to know what IT is, so I can answer the question. From having done game design I know it’s always tricky to answer, I usually say, ‘oh well it’s like…’, and then apply 3 different analogies, all meaning different things.</p>
<br>

<p style = "color: red; text-align: center;">I’d like to acquire the necessary skills, or at least, learn what I need to learn, to set me up for a job in the I.T. industry.</p>
<br>

<p style = "color: red; text-align: center;">Also the fundamentals of cybersecurity I'm going to be working professionally or otherwise, online and on computers.</p>

<h4>My personality types, apparently</h4>
<br><br><br>
<img src="Go1.PNG" alt="Go1 didn't load">
<br>
<p>What does it mean to me? Honestly this isn’t too inaccurate: what this says sync’s up with how I’ve handled things in the past, especially acting as a social counsellor for mates and teammates, come to think of it.
  <br>
How do I think this’ll influence my behaviour in a team? Not at all, really. By all means a bit of self-actualisation never hurt anyone, but if you take a personality test (are you a <i>Beastmaster</i>, or a <i>Hierophant</i>?), then shape your life around it or let it influence you, I think you’re going about it the wrong way. Though I may have misunderstood the question, mind. <br>
How should I take this into account when forming a team? Perhaps look for people who are unlike me: when you can’t communicate face-to-face (this was the main fear of uni group work: in person I’d have no problems with it), I always err on the side of caution ane make sure everyone knows what they’re doing or is alright with their workload - think I sort of, perhaps unconsciously a bit try and angle for a bit more than my fair share of the work, because I say to myself ‘well at least that’s one thing that won’t go wrong’, not to say that I’ll get it perfect, but that I can have a greater degree of control (oh that weirds me out to read that) over the final score. I think. But yeah: try and team up with more doers, than thinkers.
</p>
<br><br>

<br>
<p>What do the results mean for me? I think I’m less caring of this one, as for a previous subject I needed to do one of these and the results came up different - though that’s not to say people can’t change. Although I am rather distraction prone (doesn’t help when I work on a computer, with all of my games and the internet at my fingertips), and I am a big fan of colour coding things: Atom found a fan in me! (Not sure if you can change the background colour on Notepad++ and the PythonShell.) <br>
How do I think this’ll influence my behaviour in a team? Not that much, but on my end once I have my assigned duties I’ll have a better idea of how to go about them: take handwritten notes (not typed) and try out some mental / mind maps. <br>
How should I take this into account when forming a team? I don’t think it will / should matter too much: a great sound engineer might be a high visual learner, the best 3D modeller could be a an auditory learner, and a very kinesthetic learner might be a gun at AUSLAN (ran out of ideas pretty quick there). So while I don’t think it’ll influence anyone’s decisions, our results can serve as a good conversation piece or ice-breaker.

<br>
<p>What do the results of this test mean to me? Of all the tests this is the one that I’d be closest to ‘objecting’ to. I couldn’t put my finger on any one score and say ‘this isn’t right’, because I don’t grandly subscribe to this sort of thing (though I do appreciate the ability of any thing that helps individuals better themselves), but being something called an introverted extrovert probably doesn’t help matters… Or is it the other way around? <br>
How do I think this’ll influence my behaviour in a team? As before, I don’t think it will. However for the ones that do stand out as being fairly spot-on (I mostly answered honestly, relative to how I was feeling), it can help you figure out where you do and don’t click. For me the ‘openness’ one I’d say was pretty spot on: this could manifest itself (look at me and my Year 11 psychology!) as thinking and indeed overthinking problems, whereas someone on the other end of the scale may go: “There is the problem, yo I’ll solve it!”, where I may be more inclined to check out the hook, while their DJ revolves it. <br>
How should I take this into account when forming a team? Well, if we don’t fully disagree with the tests, or can single out one or two things that we do agree with, it may make the delegation of tasks a touch easier, potentially. If they’re, say, open and neurotic and worrying about their contribution, others could point out that they’re just being ‘too open and neurotic’, which to me sounds pretty mean. But if they’re more of a (strong) silent type, rather private, but they do the work, others may need not worry about them, because they just like to know their job and do it.

<h3>Project Idea</h3>
<br>
<p>(I was going to have three ideas here as well but ran out of time: one was a Ren’Py game (because I am Mr. Original) and the other was a chat / chatter bot that boosted user esteem while reminding them of the outside world.)</p>
<br>
<p>Overview: <br> My idea is for a Raspberry Pi life awareness monitor / reminder device. From some Googling around I found that there were a few devices and programs that had some of these ideas, but nothing that included all of them. The core loop is that at pre-arranged times the device will emit a constant, low-volume beeping and flashing of lights that can only be shut off by the user scanning in their RFID tag.</p>
<br>
<p>Motivation: <br> I can, at times, get sucked into video games. The same goes for books. The problem I have is that by poor choice or curel serendipity I lose myself for hours… when time perhaps should be better spent on my studies or skills I want to further. <br>
I also used to look good, damn good! In the past I would work out or exercise every night and I ate quite healthy, as I lived on my own and cooked all of my own meals. But then I came back, and kinda let myself go. It’s one thing to say that you used to be, really fit, that you used to have a goatee down to your pecs, but when you bring it up again - even just in your head - that ‘oh back in Melbourne…’ wait how long ago was that? <br> The intent of this device is to combine the two with a short, seven-day planner as I can get pretty disorganised, or at least lose time, here and there. I would place it low to the ground so that, if I’m already close to the floor, why not do a few pushups? That done, how about some situps and squats? </p>
<br>
<p>Description: The device itself is to be a Raspberry Pi with a 3.5 inch screen (plus stylus), a trio of LED lights on one side, a beeping sound emitter on the other, basic programming for a seven day calendar and real time clock (with a battery) and finally an RFID reader. <br> Tools and Technologies (100) words) - Describe the software, hardware and/or other equipment needed. Include any relevant open source tools as appropriate.

</p>

<p>Skills Required: <br> The Python language, so far. As it’s a computer rather than ‘things to go on a circuit board’, not even soldering is required.
<br>
<br>
If the project is successful, I will have a device that enforces organisation and prompts me to live a healthier life, all without taking away my agency. If I don’t want it on I won’t set it, however whatever malus I reap as a result of that is down to me as well. As it’s an offshoot of Raspberry Pi I don’t know the exact details but I doubt it’d be commercially viable to sell: why buy it when you can make it all yourself for far cheaper? I would be more than happy to release the details of its construction and programming, along with a detailed guide, onlin, either to ‘grand repository of python code’, or somewhere like my GitHub page.
